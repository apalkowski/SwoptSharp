# [Sw]arm [opt]imization for C Sharp
A collection of swarm intelligence algorithms for general optimisation purposes.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

My aim is to provide a collection of all known swarm algorithms with means to solve various optimisation issues.

Due to my other work and the fact that I am not a professional programmer do not expect anything quick and anything great. But I will do my best! I treat this as a project just for sheer programming fun, however I would want it to grow with time into something solid and useful. I will firstly try to implement some of the less common algorithms (like RFD or CS).

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

## Todo
nearly everything :sweat_smile:

Mainly:
- [ ] problem space formulation
  - [x] graphs
  - [ ] continuous space
  - [ ] definitions of specific fitness functions and other measures
- [ ] swarm algorithms
  - [ ] River Formation Dynamics
  - [ ] Cuckoo Search
  - [ ] Ant Colony Optimization
  - [ ] Particle Swarm Optimization
  - [ ] ... and other
