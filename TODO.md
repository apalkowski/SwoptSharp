  - [ ] Fix IEnumerator interface
  - [ ] Edge class and/or some connected generic value?
  - [ ] Broaden edge addition capabilities (add by key, not only by an instance of GraphNode?)
- [ ] GraphNode.cs
  - [ ] Add optional generic values
- [ ] problem space formulation
  - [x] graphs
  - [ ] continuous space
  - [ ] definitions of specific fitness functions and other measures
- [ ] swarm algorithms
  - [ ] River Formation Dynamics
  - [ ] Cuckoo Search
  - [ ] Ant Colony Optimization
  - [ ] Particle Swarm Optimization
  - [ ] ... and other
